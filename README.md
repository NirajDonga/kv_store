# Distributed Key-Value Store (Persistent & Proxy-Based)

This is a C++ project demonstrating a production-ready **Distributed Key-Value Store** architecture. It implements **Consistent Hashing** for dynamic scaling, **Write-Ahead Logs (WAL)** for data persistence, and a **Proxy Gateway** pattern to decouple clients from storage logic.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Consistent Hashing:** Distributes data across nodes with minimal movement during scaling.
* **Persistence (WAL):** Implementation of a Write-Ahead Log to ensure data survives server restarts.
* **Proxy Architecture:** A "Smart Gateway" handles all routing and rebalancing, allowing for "Thin Clients".
* **Dynamic Scaling:** Add or remove nodes on the fly with automatic data migration.
* **Internal Sharding:** High-concurrency local storage using mutex-protected shards.

## 🛠️ Architecture

1.  **Client (`kv_client`):** A dumb terminal. Connects *only* to the Proxy.
2.  **Proxy (`kv_proxy`):** The brain. Holds the Hash Ring, routes requests, and manages data migration.
3.  **Server (`kv_server`):** The storage. Saves data to memory and appends to a disk log (`wal_PORT.log`).

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
2. Start the Cluster
You will need 4 separate terminals to simulate the cluster on one machine.

Terminal 1: Storage Node A (Port 8081)

Bash

./kv_server 8081
# Output: --- Persistent Server Port 8081 (WAL: wal_8081.log) ---
Terminal 2: Storage Node B (Port 8082)

Bash

./kv_server 8082
# Output: --- Persistent Server Port 8082 (WAL: wal_8082.log) ---
Terminal 3: The Proxy (Port 8000)

Bash

./kv_proxy
# Output: --- KV Proxy/Gateway running on Port 8000 ---
Terminal 4: The Client

Bash

./kv_client
# Output: --- Thin KV Client (Connected to Proxy:8000) ---
🎮 Usage
Once the client is running, you can interact with the system. The commands are sent to the Proxy, which handles the rest.

1. Initialize the Cluster
Tell the proxy about your storage nodes.

Plaintext

> ADD 127.0.0.1:8081
[Proxy] Node Added: 127.0.0.1:8081

> ADD 127.0.0.1:8082
[Proxy] Node Added: 127.0.0.1:8082
2. Store & Retrieve Data
Plaintext

> SET user1 Alice
OK

> GET user1
Value: Alice
The Proxy automatically hashed user1 and routed it to either 8081 or 8082.

3. Verify Persistence (The "Kill Test")
Stop the server holding your data (Ctrl+C in Terminal 1 or 2).

Restart that server (./kv_server 8081).

Get the key again in the client.

Plaintext

> GET user1
Value: Alice
It works! The server replayed wal_8081.log on startup.

4. Dynamic Scaling (Rebalancing)
Add a new node and watch data move automatically.

Plaintext

> ADD 127.0.0.1:8083
[Proxy] Rebalancing for new node...
[Proxy] Rebalancing Complete.
5. Remove a Node (Evacuation)
Safely remove a node; the proxy will move its data to others before it disconnects.

Plaintext

> REMOVE 127.0.0.1:8081
[Proxy] Evacuating node...
[Proxy] Node Removed.
